# Creative Computing: Advice for Future Learners

As you may or may not be able to tell, this is my first attempt at github, markdown and creative computing. This file is specifically for art students who are being introduced to this pathway and are feeling intimidated or overwhelmed. I know that I was. By sharing my experiences and thoughtsfrom this week in Creative Computing, I hope I can offer reassurance that it isn't as frightening as you may think.

**TinkerCAD**

One aspect we went over this week was Physical Computing and Arduino. I can honestly say that my mind was fried. I felt like I was back in Year 8 Computer Science. But what I will say is that TinkerCAD is a really helpful tool to familiarise yourself with this computing mindset, either alongside a physical Arduino kit or solely digitally. TinkerCAD offers some really helpful step by step guides into circuit simulations; it's broken down in an easy to understand way. It really sums up the Open Source methodology. 

**Be Autodidactic**

One thing this course has taught me so far is the importance of self-education. Minimally engaging with the course will only get you so far. It's up to you to do extra research and put in extra hours to get ti grips with your work. For me, this part of the unit was not my forte; I found it really confusing. So I went beyond the reading list, looking into basic lessons in Arduino, TinkerCAD and GitHub just to wrap my head around these tools. Now, I feel a little more confident in this field compared to if I just half-assed my way through the week.
