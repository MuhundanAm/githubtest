# Creative Computing: Advice for Future Learners

As you may or may not be able to tell, this is my first attempt at github, markdown and creative computing. This file is specifically for art students who are being introduced to this pathway and are feeling intimidated or overwhelmed. I know that I was. By sharing my experiences and thoughtsfrom this week in Creative Computing, I hope I can offer reassurance that it isn't as frightening as you may think.

**TinkerCAD**

One aspect we went over this week was Physical Computing and Arduino. I can honestly say that my mind was fried. I felt like I was back in Year 8 Computer Science. But what I will say is that TinkerCAD is a really helpful tool to familiarise yourself with this computing mindset, either alongside a physical Arduino kit or solely digitally. TinkerCAD offers some really helpful step by step guides into circuit simulations; it's broken down in an easy to understand way. It really sums up the Open Source methodology. Just crack on some music, and get on with it. Play. Experiment. Learn.

**Be Autodidactic**

One thing this course has taught me so far is the importance of self-education. Minimally engaging with the course will only get you so far. It's up to you to do extra research and put in extra hours to get ti grips with your work. For me, this part of the unit was not my forte; I found it really confusing. So I went beyond the reading list, looking into basic lessons in Arduino, TinkerCAD, GitHub and writing in Markdown just to wrap my head around these tools. Now, I feel a little more confident in this field compared to if I just half-assed my way through the week.

**Final Thoughts**

I know alot of you may be thinking *"Why is this in a Graphic Communication Design course? This isn't what I signed up for."* But trust me, when you come out on the other side of it you'll be grateful that you did it. As a designer, you have to get used to being pushed out of your comfort zone. I'm only 5 weeks in and I know that this course will do so. Imagine, in the near or far future, you're faced with a design problem that requires a computing solution. Even with this basic knowledge from 1 week of Creative Computing, I will know what direction to look into. Maybe it will lead to a collaboration with someone in the field? Maybe it will force you to learn the skills to a higher level? Having that little bit of awareness and knowledge will make your life so much easier than mindlessly seeking a solution you know absolutely nothing about. To be a good graphic communicater or graphic designer, you have to be eclectic. You have to know more than just screen-printing and Adobe. So make the most of it. All these new, intimidating topics and methods because you will become a much better designer because of it.
